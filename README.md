### Project Overview:
This data analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales revenue performance and quantity of products per category reviewed by customers for the Amazon online e-commerce products over the past years. By analyzing the various Parameters in the data received, we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions, which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gained and to know the best performance from our data.
### Data Source : 
The primary source of the data used here is the data sales. Excel and this is an open source dataset that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as Amazon Data source or any other data repository site.
### Tool Used:

  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For data analysis and Visualization
- SQL:

### Data Cleaning and Preparations:
 In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following actions:

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
